<h2>üèÅ Goals</h2>


   - Pipex's main objective is to teach how to manipulate processes and communication between them in the Unix environment, using the C programming language. By simulating the behavior of the shell pipeline, practical skills are developed in the use of system calls such as pipe(), fork() and execve(), in addition to learning how to deal with input and output file redirection. This project also forces you to deal with various aspects of resource management, such as correctly opening and closing file descriptors, ensuring that there are no resource leaks.
   
  - Additionally, Pipex enhances the ability to debug and handle errors effectively, a crucial skill in low-level programming. By implementing functionality that connects the output of one command to the input of another, you gain in-depth understanding of the interaction between processes and the efficient management of system resources. In summary, the project not only reinforces specific technical knowledge about system calls and IPC, but also improves general troubleshooting, debugging, and robust and efficient software development skills.
